# The challenge

**Import Database**

    If you chose one of the local SQL environments, import the downloaded SQL dump into your local environment by your preferred method (tested via terminal). Make sure the import process completes successfully.

    If you chose the online PostgreSQL environment, head to https://sqliteonline.com/, click on PostgreSQL on the left sidebar, paste the dump contents, and run the script. You should see the created tables on the sidebar.

**Inspect Database**

    Take a moment to examine the imported database to understand its structure, including the models and data it contains.

**Query Database**

    Use an SQL query to find the answer to the following question: "How many students who enrolled in at least 5 groups between the start of February 5 and the end of February 7, enrolled in at least one subject with a code ending in `1`?"

   **Warning!** The value `2024-02-07` represents the start of February 7, not its end.


# The environment
